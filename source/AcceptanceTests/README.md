# Acceptance Tests

## Getting started
In order to run the acceptance tests locally, you need to setup local settings to point at the target environment 
and an azp token. 

- Make a copy of integrationtest.local.settings.sample.json called integrationtest.local.settings.json
  - Update the settings with the excepted values. 
    - SHARED_KEYVAULT_NAME: key vault from the target environment
    - AZP_TOKEN: target token 
- Log in to the Azure CLI using the az login command.
  - Find Azure CLI installation guidance here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
