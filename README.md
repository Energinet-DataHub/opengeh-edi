# MarketRoles

## Intro

The market roles domain is in charge of supply and consumer relations.
It handles changes in supply (who supplies/produces electricity),
and changes in consumers/producers (who is a consumer), on metering points.

These are the processes maintained by this domain.

| Process                                                                      |

| [End of Supply](.\docs\business-processes\end-of-supply.md)                  |
| Forced Energy Supplier change                                                |
| Incorrect Energy Supplier change                                             |
| Consumer move in                                                             |
| Consumer move out                                                            |
| Incorrect move                                                               |
| Forward consumer master data by Energy Supplier                              |
| Forward contact address by grid operator                                     |
| ....                                                                         |
