# MarketRoles

## Intro

The market roles domain is in charge of supply and consumer relations.
It handles changes in supply (who supplies/produces electricity),
and changes in consumers/producers (who is a customer), on metering points.

These are the processes maintained by this domain.

| Process                                                               |

| Forced supplier change                                                |
| Incorrect supplier change                                             |
| Customer move in                                                      |
